## 💳 Loan Management

### Loan System Overview
The app uses a **month-by-month interest accumulation** system:
- **Percentage-Based Monthly Interest**: Admin-controlled rate (default: 5% of principal per month)
- **Scalable Interest**: Interest amount automatically adjusts based on loan size
- **Simple Interest**: No compounding, calculated monthly on original principal
- **Accumulation**: Interest adds up each month regardless of payments
- **Payment Priority**: Payments go to principal first, then interest
- **Dynamic Rates**: Interest rates can be adjusted by administrators

### Applying for Loans
1. **Dashboard** → **New Loan** or **More** → **Apply for Loan**
2. Fill application:
   - **Member** - Loan applicant
   - **Amount** - Loan principal
   - **Purpose** - Reason for loan
   - **Expected Term** - Estimated repayment period
   - **Interest Rate** - Annual rate (for reference)
   - **Guarantors** - Optional guarantors
   - **Collateral** - Optional security

### Loan Calculations
**Example**: 100,000 CFA loan at default 5% monthly rate
- **Monthly Interest**: 100,000 × 5% = 5,000 CFA per month
- **After 6 months**: 5,000 × 6 = 30,000 CFA total interest
- **If 40,000 paid**: Principal remaining = 60,000 CFA, Interest due = 30,000 CFA
- **Total due**: 90,000 CFA

**Different Loan Size**: 50,000 CFA loan at same 5% monthly rate
- **Monthly Interest**: 50,000 × 5% = 2,500 CFA per month
- **After 6 months**: 2,500 × 6 = 15,000 CFA total interest
- **If 20,000 paid**: Principal remaining = 30,000 CFA, Interest due = 15,000 CFA
- **Total due**: 45,000 CFA

**Rate Comparison**: 100,000 CFA loan at 3% vs 5% monthly rate
- **At 3%**: 3,000 CFA monthly interest
- **At 5%**: 5,000 CFA monthly interest
- **Difference**: 2,000 CFA more per month at higher rate
