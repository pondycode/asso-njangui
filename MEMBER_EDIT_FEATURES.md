# Member Edit Functionality

This document describes the newly added member edit functionality to the Asso Njangui application.

## Features Added

### 1. Edit Member Screen (`edit_member_screen.dart`)
A comprehensive edit screen that allows users to:
- Modify member personal information (name, email, phone, address)
- Update date of birth
- Change member status
- Edit national ID and occupation
- View read-only member statistics (join date, age, membership duration)
- Delete member with confirmation dialog

### 2. Updated Member Detail Screen
The member detail screen now:
- Has a working edit button that navigates to the edit screen
- Displays updated member information after editing
- Handles member deletion by returning to the previous screen
- Updates member status through both popup menu and edit screen

### 3. Features of the Edit Screen

#### Personal Information Section
- First Name* (required)
- Last Name* (required)
- Email (optional, with validation)
- Phone Number* (required)
- Address (optional, multiline)
- Date of Birth* (required, date picker)

#### Additional Information Section
- National ID (optional)
- Occupation (optional)
- Status (dropdown with Active, Inactive, Suspended, Pending options)

#### Member Statistics Section (Read-only)
- Member since date
- Current age
- Membership duration in days

#### Actions
- **Update Member**: Saves all changes and returns to detail screen
- **Delete Member**: Shows confirmation dialog and removes member entirely

### 4. Navigation Flow
```
Member List → Member Detail → Edit Member
     ↑              ↑              ↓
     └──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

- From Member List: Tap member → View details → Tap edit button
- From Edit Screen: Update returns to detail screen, Delete returns to list
- Auto-refresh: List and detail screens update automatically when member data changes

### 5. Validation and Error Handling
- Form validation for required fields
- Email format validation
- Date of birth validation
- Error messages with user-friendly snackbars
- Loading states during save/delete operations

### 6. Integration with App State
- Uses existing AppStateProvider methods:
  - `updateMember(Member member)` for updating
  - `deleteMember(String memberId)` for deletion
- Automatic UI refresh through Consumer widgets
- Consistent data across all screens

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
1. **EditMemberScreen**: Main edit form with validation
2. **Updated MemberDetailScreen**: Enhanced with edit navigation and state management
3. **AppStateProvider Integration**: Uses existing CRUD operations

### Form Controls
- TextFormField widgets with validation
- DropdownButtonFormField for status selection
- InkWell with InputDecorator for date picker
- Card layouts for organized sections

### State Management
- Local form state in EditMemberScreen
- Current member tracking in MemberDetailScreen
- Global state updates through AppStateProvider

## Usage Examples

### Opening Edit Screen
```dart
// From Member Detail Screen
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.edit),
  onPressed: _navigateToEditMember,
),

// Navigation method
Future<void> _navigateToEditMember() async {
  final result = await Navigator.push<dynamic>(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => EditMemberScreen(member: _currentMember),
    ),
  );
  
  if (result is Member) {
    // Member was updated
    setState(() {
      _currentMember = result;
    });
  } else if (result == 'deleted') {
    // Member was deleted, go back
    Navigator.pop(context);
  }
}
```

### Form Validation
```dart
TextFormField(
  controller: _emailController,
  validator: (value) {
    if (value != null && value.trim().isNotEmpty) {
      final emailRegex = RegExp(r'^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$');
      if (!emailRegex.hasMatch(value.trim())) {
        return 'Please enter a valid email address';
      }
    }
    return null;
  },
)
```

### Member Update
```dart
final updatedMember = widget.member.copyWith(
  firstName: _firstNameController.text.trim(),
  lastName: _lastNameController.text.trim(),
  email: _emailController.text.trim().isNotEmpty 
      ? _emailController.text.trim() 
      : null,
  // ... other fields
  lastActivityDate: DateTime.now(),
);

await context.read<AppStateProvider>().updateMember(updatedMember);
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Photo upload for member profile pictures
2. Bulk member operations (bulk edit, bulk status change)
3. Member history/audit log
4. Export member data functionality
5. Advanced search and filtering in edit screen
6. Member merge functionality for duplicate handling

## Testing

The edit functionality has been:
- Analyzed with `flutter analyze` (no errors)
- Integrated with existing AppStateProvider
- Designed to work with existing UI patterns
- Validated for proper state management

To test:
1. Run the app
2. Navigate to Members → Select a member → Tap edit button
3. Try updating various fields and saving
4. Test delete functionality with confirmation dialog
5. Verify that changes reflect in list and detail screens
